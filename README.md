# TicFracToe


This is a fractal Tic-Tac-Toe game.
I'll add the rules in later.
This game DOES NOT currently work at all.
I am aware that the code is inefficient and sloppily written, this was just a project I was messing around with for fun. At some point I will rewrite it and make it actually function.

Update: The game is now semi-playable. Not great and still buggy, but you can actually play tic-frac-toe with it.
